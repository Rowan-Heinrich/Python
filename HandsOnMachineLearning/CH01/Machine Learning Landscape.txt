What is Machine Learning:
A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T
and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves
with experience E.
â€”Tom Mitchell, 1997


Machine Learning is great for: 
- problems with lots of hand tuning
- complex problems for which there is no good solution. 
- fluctuating enviornments and continuous new data. 
- getting insights on complex data

types of Machine Learning: 
- trained with human supervision
	- supervised learning (classification): training data includes the desired solution (labels & class). data is classified by program.
	- supervised learning (regression): predicting the price of a car based on features (Predictors).
	- supervised learning (logistic regression): used for classification as it outputs a probability of belonging to a class. 
	- Unsupervised learning (unlabled data): system is given data without labels and system learns without a teacher.
- can they learn on the fly
- can they work by comparing new data points to known datapoints (or detect paterns). 

note: attribute is a data type (milage), Feature is attribute + value (milage, 15,000kms)

Supervised Learning Algorithms: 
 - k-nearest neighbor
 - linear regression
 - logistic regression
 - support vector machines (SVM's) 
 - Decision Trees and Random Forests
 - Neural Networks

Unsupervised learning algorithms: 
 - Clusering (k-means, Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA), Expectation Maximisation).
 - Visualisation & Dimensionality reduction (Principal component analysis (PCA), Kernal PCA, Locally-linear Embedding (LLE)
t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE)
 - Association Rule Learning (Apriori,  Eclat). 

Feature Extraction : dimentionallty reduction (combining features to form another (age and milage to form wear and tear).
